\usage{
score_forecasts(
  forecasts,
  truth,
  return_format = "wide",
  metrics = c("abs_error", "wis", "wis_components", "interval_coverage",
    "quantile_coverage"),
  use_median_as_point = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{forecasts}{required data.frame with forecasts in the format returned
by \code{\link{load_forecasts}}}

\item{truth}{required data.frame with forecasts in the format returned
by \code{\link{load_truth}}}

\item{return_format}{string: \code{"long"} returns long format with a column for
\code{"score_name"} and a column for \code{"score_value"}; \code{"wide"} returns wide format with
a separate column for each score. Defaults to \code{"wide"}.}

\item{metrics}{character vector of the metrics to be returned with options
\code{"abs_error"}, \code{"wis"}, \code{"wis_components"},\code{"interval_coverage"}, and \code{"quantile_coverage"}}

\item{use_median_as_point}{logical: \code{TRUE} uses the median as the point
forecast when scoring; \code{FALSE} uses the point forecasts from the data when
scoring. Defaults to \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
data.frame with scores. The result will have some columns that
define the observation, namely, \code{model}, \code{forecast_date}, \code{location},
\code{horizon}, \code{temporal_resolution}, \code{target_variable}, \code{horizon}, and
\code{target_end_date}.
Other columns will contain scores dependent on metrics parameter:
\itemize{
\item \code{true_value} is the observed truth at that \code{location} and \code{target_end_date} (always returned)
\item \code{abs_error} is the absolute error based on median estimate if
use_median_as_point is TRUE, and absolute error based on point forecast
if use_median_as_point is FALSE
\item \code{wis} is the weighted interval score
\item \code{dispersion} the component of WIS made up of interval widths
\item \code{overprediction} the component of WIS made up of overprediction of intervals
\item \code{underprediction} the component of WIS made up of underprediction of intervals
\item \code{coverage_X} are prediction interval coverage at alpha level X
\item \code{quantile_coverage_0.X} are one-sided quantile coverage at quantile X
}

If return_format is \code{"long"}, also contains columns score_name and score_value
where \code{score_name} is the type of score calculated and \code{score_value} has the numeric
value of the score.
If return_format is \code{"wide"}, each calculated score is in its own column.
