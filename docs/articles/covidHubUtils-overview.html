<p>The <a href="https://covid19forecasthub.org/" class="external-link">COVID-19 Forecast Hub</a> is a central repository for modeler-contributed short-term forecasts of COVID-19 trends in the US. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) displays forecasts from the Forecast Hub on its <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/mathematical-modeling.html" class="external-link">modeling and forecasting webpages</a>.</p>
<p>The Forecast Hub has been curating forecast data since April 2020, and has collected over 150 million unique rows of forecast data. These data are stored in our <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub" class="external-link">public GitHub repository</a> and in the <a href="https://zoltardata.com/" class="external-link">Zoltar forecast archive</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of the <code>covidHubUtils</code> R package is to create a set of basic utility functions for accessing, visualizing, and scoring forecasts from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub.</p>

<p>The <code>covidHubUtils</code> package relies on a small number of packages, including many from the <code>tidyverse</code> and, importantly, <a href="http://reichlab.io/zoltr/" class="external-link">the <code>zoltr</code> package</a> that is used to access the Zoltar API for downloading forecasts. Please install <code>zoltr</code> from GitHub, as this development version often has important features not yet on the CRAN version:</p>

<p>The <code>covidHubUtils</code> package currently is only available on GitHub, and it may be installed using the <code>remotes</code> package:</p>

</h2>
<p>One of the key features of the COVID-19 Forecast Hub is making millions of rows of forecast data available in a standard format for easy analysis and visualization. The <code>covidHubUtils</code> package allows for users to download data into an R session either by reading files from a local clone of <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub" class="external-link">the COVID-19 Forecast Hub repository</a> or by downloading data from the Zoltar API. (While Zoltar currently requires a user account to download data via the API, we have created a specific user account for <code>covidHubUtils</code> so that a user account is not needed.)</p>
<p>We have identified two central use cases for downloading data using <code><a href="../reference/load_forecasts.html">load_forecasts()</a></code>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Downloading the “latest” forecasts for selected models that might be submitted in a short period of time. This is achieved by using <code>dates</code> and <code>date_window_size</code> parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Downloading all available forecasts for selected models that are submitted on a set of dates. This is achieved by using a vector of dates in <code>dates</code> parameter.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Below are some examples of reading in data. We start by loading the <code>covidHubUtils</code> package and the <code>tidyverse</code>.</p>

<p>The following code loads forecasts from Zoltar for the COVIDhub-ensemble model. Note that the <code>date_window_size</code> parameter specifies the range of days to look at for a forecast. <code>date_window_size</code> will be applied to every date in <code>dates</code> parameter to create a list of potential forecast dates to look at. All queries below are looking for the most recent forecast from COVIDhub-ensemble in the span of 2021-03-02 through 2021-03-08. In this case, for each day in <code>dates</code>, <code>date_window_size = 6</code> covers a full week, starting from 6 days before a date and going up through the user-provided date. By default, <code>date_window_size</code> is set to 0 to use all forecast dates in <code>dates</code> only.</p>
<p>We also provide examples to load incident hospitalization forecasts and incident death forecasts here by changing <code>targets</code> to the desired quantity.</p>
<p>The <code>verbose</code> parameter has been explicitly set to <code>FALSE</code> to prevent output from the internal helper function in <code><a href="../reference/load_forecasts.html">load_forecasts()</a></code>. It is set to <code>TRUE</code> by default and all information will be printed in the console.</p>

<p>Here are the top rows of the data frame from the query of incident case forecasts. In addition to the essential forecast data, a few columns with location information are also returned. Tables of the other target variables look similar. Note that one row corresponds either to a point or a single quantile prediction.

<p>Some additional arguments in <code><a href="../reference/plot_forecasts.html">plot_forecasts()</a></code> are helpful for creating a reasonable plot if <code>forecast_data</code> has multiple locations, forecast dates or models.</p>
<p>The following code looks at three models’ forecasts of incident deaths at one time point for one location. Note the use of the <code>fill_by_model</code> option which allows colors to vary by model and the <code>facet</code> command which is passed to ggplot.</p>

<p>By default <code><a href="../reference/plot_forecasts.html">plot_forecasts()</a></code> uses JHU CSSE data as the “Observed Data” in the above plots. However, users can specify custom “ground truth” data that either they provide themselves or that is loaded in from the package.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a call to <code><a href="../reference/plot_forecasts.html">plot_forecasts()</a></code> that simply specifies an alternate truth source, which must be one of “JHU”, “HealthData” or “NYTimes”.</p>

</h2>
<p>In addition to querying forecasts and truth data, <code>covidHubUtils</code> has the capability to evaluate the forecasts based on metrics including the prediction interval coverage at any provided quantiles, the absolute error based on a median estimate, the weighted interval score (WIS) of the forecast, and a component-wise breakdown of WIS into dispersion, overprediction and underprediction.</p>
<p>These scores could be used to compare the accuracy and precision of forecasts across models, locations, horizons, and submission weeks. You can access the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.21250974v1" class="external-link">evaluation paper</a> to read an in-depth explanation about the methodologies.</p>
<p>To find the most recent weekly forecast evaluation summary, please visit the <a href="https://covid19forecasthub.org/eval-reports/" class="external-link">evaluation reports page</a> and <a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/forecast-eval/" class="external-link">the Forecast Evaluation Dashboard</a> built by the CMU Delphi team and the COVID-19 Forecast Hub.</p>

<p>The inputs to the <code>scored_forecasts()</code> include a <code>forecasts</code> data frame created by <code><a href="../reference/load_forecasts.html">load_forecasts()</a></code> and a <code>truth</code> data frame created by <code><a href="../reference/load_truth.html">load_truth()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The <code>scoringutils</code> package provides a collection of metrics and proper scoring rules that make it simple to score forecasts against the true observed values. Please install and load the most up-to-date development version of <code>scoringutils</code> from GitHub:</p>

<p>We use plotting functions from <code>scoringutils</code> to visualize different scoring metrics.</p>
<p>Heatmaps are a great way to visualize your data over a large number of models. The following code provides a skeleton for visualizing the WIS score of multiple models over the 4 horizons:</p>
